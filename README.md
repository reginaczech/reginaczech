# About ME!
Hi, I'm @reginaczech. I used to work in the manufacturing sector, producing beer and helping the UK go round. Now, I'm a full stack developer all about sharing knowledge and connecting with others in the tech community. If you're interested in discussing new technologies, collaborating on projects, or just chatting about tech, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me an email at regina.czech@yahoo.com.
